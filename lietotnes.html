                        <li>Track your time anywhere—on the desktop or the mobile app. The time-tracker works across devices and links time data to ClickUp tasks</li>
                        <li>The ability to manually add time entries for past activities and even edit previously tracked entries makes project time-tracking a breeze</li>
                        <li>Forecast and set expectations with time estimates, split time estimates between team members on tasks, and view rollups for time estimates to get the bigger picture </li>
                        <li>Distinguish between billable and non-billable hours to charge your clients accurately</li>
                        <li>Switch from one environment to another without losing out on the current progress of the timer using ClickUp’s global timer ⌛</li>
                        <li>Use pre-built templates such as the Time Management Schedule Template, time log templates, and more to organize your day and projects without breaking a sweat</li>

                        <li>Create sub-tasks within tasks and even add dependencies within tasks</li>
                        <li>Prebuilt template to implement time management techniques such as David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”® (GTD®) approach</li>
                    </ul>
